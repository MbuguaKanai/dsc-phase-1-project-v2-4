## Project Overview

This project uses exploratory data analysis to generate insights for Microsft on its anticipated entry into the movie  industry.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Business Understanding

### Data understanding
The first step was to load all the datasets using the relevant libraries. The following datasets were successfully read and viewed.
1.	bom.movie_gross.csv.gz
2.	rt.movie_info.tsv.gz
3.	rt.reviews.tsv.gz
4.	tmdb.movies.csv.gz
5.	tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
Data understanding also involved ascertaining how many rows and columns each of the datasets had and the datatypes of each of the columns.
### Data Preparation
This section dealt with all the missing values. 
Some of the missing values were dropped and others were intelligently replaced.
I also converted datatypes of columns to appropriate datatypes to facilitate feature engineering.
### Data Analysis and visualization
